# senior
rPi code

Ok this is gonna be a pain in the ass

1. Copy all of the files in the repo to the senior design folder

2. Now run the script file "runFirst.sh". Its just a bunch of Unix commands so if it fails,
just go in and run them manually. This script compliles/installs the library

3. Compilation:

```bash
 gcc -Wall -pthread -o mainPy mainPy.cpp -lpigpio -lrt
```

:] hopefully no errorx
